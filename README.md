4. Login Authentication
4.1. Database Schema
Login authentication in the Smart Scheduler relies on a well-structured database schema, particularly the users table:

employee Table

Columns:
emp_id (Primary Key)	
name	
email	
password	
gender	
department	
mobile_number

Description:
The users table stores user credentials and role information. Each user is uniquely identified by a user_id. The username field represents the user's login identifier, the password field stores the hashed user password for security, and the role field designates the user's role within the system.
4.2. Backend (PHP)
User Authentication
User authentication is a critical part of the backend functionality. PHP includes functions to authenticate users during the login process. This involves querying the employee table to verify the entered username and hashed password against the stored credentials.
4.3. Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)
Login Form
The frontend incorporates a login form designed using HTML, styled with CSS, and made interactive with JavaScript. The form captures user input for the username and password, providing a seamless and secure user authentication experience.

CSS Styling
CSS styles the login form for a visually appealing and user-friendly layout. Styling considerations may include proper spacing, font choices, and color schemes to enhance the overall aesthetics of the login interface.

JavaScript
JavaScript is employed to enhance the interactivity of the login form. This includes form validation, where the entered credentials are checked for completeness before initiating the login process. Additionally, JavaScript handles the communication with the backend for user authentication.
## Timetable Management
5.1. Database Schema
redips_batch Table

Columns:
batch_id (Primary Key)
batch_name

Description:
This table stores information about different batches within the educational institution. Each batch is uniquely identified by a batch_id, and the batch_name provides a human-readable identifier.

redips_timetable Table

Columns:
tbl_id (Primary Key)
batch_id (Foreign Key)
tbl_row
tbl_col

Description:
The redips_timetable table manages the class timetable. It associates batches with specific rows (tbl_row) and columns (tbl_col). The batch_id serves as a foreign key, linking entries to the corresponding batch in the redips_batch table.
5.2. Backend (PHP)
Connection to Database
The backend, implemented in PHP, establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the mysqli extension. This connection facilitates seamless interaction between the application and the database.

SQL Query Execution
A function named sqlQuery is defined to execute SQL statements and handle errors. This function ensures efficient communication with the database and enhances code maintainability.

Subject Retrieval
A function is implemented to fetch batch information for populating the left container of the timetable interface. This involves retrieving data from the redips_batch table and presenting it in a user-friendly manner.
